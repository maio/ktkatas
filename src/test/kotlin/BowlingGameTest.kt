/**
 * Bowling Game rules:
 *
 * The game consists of 10 frames as shown above. In each frame the player has two
 * opportunities to knock down 10 pins.
 *
 * The game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player has two rolls to knock
 * down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down,
 * plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
 *
 * A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls. The bonus for
 * that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.
 *
 * A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first roll. The frame
 * is then completed with a single roll. The bonus for that frame is the value of
 * the next two rolls.
 *
 * In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the
 * extra balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be
 * rolled in tenth frame.
